I use cheats in Sims to because story is more interesting that maintaining needs, but still like things to go in unplanned directions. For fighting games (I am not very good), I won't cheat but glitches are fair game. And for choice-based roleplay I will roll-back saves sometimes so I have the most in-character interactions, but not neccessarily to 'win'."

It all depends on my mood and goal for the day, and what game I'm playing. If I'm playing the Sims, I most often set up scenarios to aim for and while playing Rimworld, I set goals and plans which I can cheat a bit to get right, but if something interesting happens, I'll just go with it. It all depends at the end of the day."

Usually on the first playthrough I just go with what happens and when I finish the game and become more familiar with it, that's when I try creating outcomes that I like. For example in Dishonored, I'd do the first playthrough as-is but in the second I might focus more on no kills or on the third I might focus on high chaos."
